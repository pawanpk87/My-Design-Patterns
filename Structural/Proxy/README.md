# Proxy Design Pattern

Proxy is a structural design pattern that lets you provide a substitute or placeholder for another object.

A proxy controls access to the original object, allowing you to perform something either before or after the request gets through to the original object.

Proxy is a structural design pattern that provides an object that acts as a substitute for a real service object used by a client. A proxy receives client requests, does some work (access control, caching, etc.), and then passes the request to a service object.
