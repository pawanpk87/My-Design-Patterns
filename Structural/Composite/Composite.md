A single object can be treated exactly how a group of objects is treated.

Composite is a structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree
structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.

The Composite Pattern allows us to build structures of objects in the form of trees
that contain both compositions of objects and individual objects as nodes.
