# State Pattern

The state is a behavioural design pattern that lets an object alter its behaviour
when its internal state changes. It appears as if the object changed its class.

## Overview

The pattern encapsulates state into separate classes and delegates to the object
representing the current state.

In the State Pattern, state-specific behavior is encapsulated in separate classes, and the context object delegates the behavior to the object representing its current state. This pattern allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes, making the object appear to change its class.
