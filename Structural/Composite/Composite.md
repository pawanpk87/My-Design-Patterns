# Composite Pattern

The Composite Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree structures and work with these structures as if they were individual objects.

A single object can be treated exactly how a group of objects is treated.

## Overview

The Composite Pattern allows us to build structures of objects in the form of trees that contain both compositions of objects and individual objects as nodes.
