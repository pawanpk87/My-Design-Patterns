# Prototype Pattern

The Prototype Pattern allows you to make new instances by copying existing instances.

The client code can make new instances without knowing which specific class is being instantiated.

## Benefits

1. Hides the complexities of making new instances from the client.
2. Provides the option for the client to generate objects whose type is not known.

## Uses and Drawbacks

1. Should be considered when a system must create new objects of many types in a complex class hierarchy.
2. It can sometimes be complicated.
